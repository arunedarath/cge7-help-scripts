using  compile_test_from_branch.sh:
------------------------------------
This script can be used to compile test the commits to
make sure that they are not breaking the build.

a) edit  "configs_for_test" variables in the script to include the configs
that you are more likely to break because of the changes.

b) edit "TC_MAIN_PATH" variable in the script to point it to the directory where
you installed your montavista toolchains.

c) Checkout to the branch where you want to conduct the test
$ git checkout 61075_compile_test

d) Identify the commit from where you want to start the test
